"""A stable identity for the dictation app, so permissions survive a rebuild.

macOS does not remember that you granted Microphone and Accessibility to an
application by its name or its path. It remembers the code signature, and for
an ad-hoc signature that identity is the hash of the binary itself:

    designated => cdhash H"dc19729a..."

Which means every single rebuild of the app produces, as far as macOS is
concerned, a different application that has never been granted anything. The
checkbox in System Settings stays on, next to an app that no longer works.
That is the worst kind of broken, because there is nothing for the user to
see and nothing for them to fix.

A self-signed certificate fixes it for free. Signing against a certificate
makes the identity the certificate, not the binary:

    designated => identifier com.dictator.dictate and certificate leaf = H"d7bc..."

and that is unchanged by rebuilding. The certificate lives in its own keychain
under ~/.dictator so it never touches the login keychain and never asks the
user for a password.

This is not a substitute for a real Developer ID, which is what would let the
app be distributed to other people without Gatekeeper complaining. It only
fixes the identity being unstable on the machine that built it.
