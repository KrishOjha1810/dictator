"""Dictation that is simply always there.

A key you have to switch on with a command is a key you will forget you have.
The promise of hold-to-talk is that it works the way the keyboard works: you
press it and it does the thing, in any app, without having thought about it
beforehand. That means a login item, not a command.

macOS runs this through launchd, which also restarts it if it ever dies, which
matters more here than usual: a dictation key that silently stopped working is
indistinguishable from a broken keyboard.
