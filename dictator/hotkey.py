"""Hold-to-talk on a single key.

The listener itself is a tiny Swift binary (native/hotkey.swift) because only
a CGEventTap can see the Fn/Globe key, and only an event tap gives us the key
RELEASE that hold-to-talk is built on. Our existing hotkeys go through skhd,
which fires on key-press only and so cannot do this at all.

It speaks a one-line-per-gesture protocol on stdout:

    READY <key>       armed
    DOWN              key down: warm the mic NOW
    UP <held_ms>      key up: stop and transcribe
    CANCEL <held_ms>  another key joined, or the press was too short to be
                      speech. Discard whatever was warmed.

                      Note the second case is NOT invisible to the user. A
                      release that short is a clean tap, which is exactly the
                      gesture macOS acts on, so with the Globe key set to Show
                      Emoji (the common default) an aborted press opens the
                      emoji palette. We are listen-only and cannot prevent
                      that. The floor decides only whether WE transcribe.
    LOCKED            the screen locked mid-hold
    BYE               exiting, any open hold already closed

Why hold-only, with no tap or double-tap gesture: macOS runs the Globe key's
own action (emoji picker, input-source switch) on the release of a clean TAP
and ignores a HOLD. So a hold-only design collides with nothing and needs no
change to System Settings, while any tap gesture would fight the OS.
