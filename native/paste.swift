// Paste text, and put the clipboard back only once it has actually been read.
//
// The obvious version (copy, send Cmd+V, sleep, restore) is wrong, and it is
// wrong in a way that is invisible until the machine is busy: under load the
// target app has not read the pasteboard when the timer fires, so the restore
// lands first and the user gets their OLD clipboard pasted instead of what
// they said. A fixed delay is a guess about someone else's scheduling.
//
// So the text is published as a PROMISE rather than as data. The pasteboard
// calls back when something actually asks for the string, and that callback is
// a read receipt: proof the paste happened rather than a hope that it did.
// Only then is the previous clipboard restored.
//
// Also declares org.nspasteboard.ConcealedType, the convention clipboard
// managers watch for, so a dictated sentence does not end up in the user's
// clipboard history.
